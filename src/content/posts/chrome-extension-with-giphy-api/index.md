## Chrome extension

I've created a simple chrome extension with React, Redux-Observable & TypeScript.
Together with Giphy's API I'm replacing the default "new tab" screen with a GIF
based on the user's appended search query.

The personal search query is saved and will be used in the next "new tab". The
initial search query is `kitten`. Why? Because everyone loves kittens.
